# Implementation of Software Configuration Management (SCM) for File Organization System

## 1. Version Control with Git
To manage the development and versioning of the File Organization System, **Git** is used as the version control system.

### **1.1 Repository Setup**
```bash
# Initialize a Git repository
cd /path/to/project
git init
```

### **1.2 Branching Strategy**
- **main** → Stable production-ready version.
- **dev** → Active development branch.
- **feature/file-sorting** → For implementing file sorting logic.
- **feature/logging** → For adding logging and error handling.

```bash
# Create and switch to a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/file-sorting
```

### **1.3 Committing Changes**
```bash
# Add and commit changes
git add file_organizer.sh
git commit -m "Added basic file organization logic"
```

### **1.4 Merging Branches**
After testing, merge the feature branch into the **dev** branch, then into **main**:
```bash
git checkout dev
git merge feature/file-sorting
git checkout main
git merge dev
```

## 2. Change Management
### **2.1 Versioning Strategy**
Version numbers follow **Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)**:
- `v1.0.0` → Initial release.
- `v1.1.0` → Added logging functionality.
- `v1.1.1` → Bug fixes.

### **2.2 Tagging Releases**
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial stable release"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### **2.3 Tracking Changes (Changelog)**
A `CHANGELOG.md` file is maintained:
```
## [1.1.0] - 2025-04-02
### Added
- Implemented logging mechanism

## [1.0.0] - 2025-04-01
### Added
- Basic file sorting based on extensions
```

## 3. Collaboration and Code Review
- Developers create **Pull Requests (PRs)** before merging features.
- Peer review ensures code quality before merging into `main`.

### **3.1 Creating a Pull Request**
1. Push feature branch to remote:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/file-sorting
   ```
2. Open a **Pull Request** on GitHub/GitLab.
3. Request reviews from team members.

## 4. Conclusion
This SCM process ensures an organized workflow, maintains version history, and supports collaboration for the File Organization System.
